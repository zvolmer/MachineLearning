# Hey! I'm Zac Volmer 👋

I'm a Computer Science major at BYU–Idaho (certificates in Computer Programming & Machine Learning, minor in Music). I chose CS because I love turning ideas into working software — the mix of logic, design, and iteration keeps me hooked — and music gives me a creative lens I bring to engineering problems.

## What I've worked on
- **Personal website** — designed and built a responsive website for my band. (HTML/CSS/JS).  
- **Mobile app (team project)** — contributed to a React Native app: feature implementation, bug fixes, and collaboration through Git/GitHub.  
- **Unity game** — built a simple game to practice C#, game architecture, and user input handling.  

## Tech stack
Python · C# · JavaScript · HTML/CSS · SQL · Pandas · React Native · Unity · Git/GitHub

## Interests & goals
I'm actively seeking software development internships where I can grow toward a full-time engineering role. I'm especially interested in front-end, mobile, and full-stack work, and I’m excited by opportunities that let me learn applied machine learning. I’m open to collaborations, mentorship, and project-based roles.

## Fun stuff
When I'm not coding I rock climb, play guitar, snowboard, and play video games — great ways to recharge and bring fresh ideas back to the keyboard.
